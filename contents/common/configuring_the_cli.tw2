::Configuring the CLI
# Configuring the CLI

In order to configure the CLI, paste in the following text into your terminal:

```
[CONFIGURE_COMMAND]
```

You can find your token on your [settings page](http://exercism.io/my/settings).

After typing in the command, hit the `Enter` key.

After hitting the `Enter` key, you should see a notification from the CLI that a configuration file has been written.

### Important: The token above should be treated like a password and not be shared with anyone.

   For this reason, you can delete it from your shell history, if you are using Bash, by running:
   ```bash
   for X in $(history | grep "exercism configure --token=" | grep -v grep | cut -d ' ' -f1) do; history -d $X; done
   ```


When asking for help that involves a command, remove your token before sharing the command.
