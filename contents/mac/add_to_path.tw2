# Add to $PATH on a Mac

In order to for us to run the BINARY_NAME program from anywhere in our terminal, we need to add its location to the $PATH variable.

## Tutorial

### Step 1

#### Exercise

In your terminal, paste in the following to create the `bin` folder:

```
echo "export PATH=~/bin:$PATH" >> ~/.bash_profile
```

#### Verify

To verify if the `$PATH` variable was updated, paste the following command in your terminal:

```
source ~/.bash_profile
```

Next, paste the following command in your terminal:

```
BINARY_NAME
```

#### Variable updated successfully

If the terminal replies with instructions on how to use the BINARY_NAME program, you've installed BINARY_NAME successfully! Give yourself a pat on the back.

#### Variable not updated

If the terminal replies saying that the BINARY_NAME command is not found, it means that the variable wasn't updated.

### Wrapping up

If you've reached the end of this tutorial without any problems, you have installed BINARY_NAME successfully!
