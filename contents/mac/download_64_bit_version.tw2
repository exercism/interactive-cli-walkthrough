## Step 1

Open your browser and navigate to this page:

```
https://github.com/exercism/cli/releases/latest
```

To verify you are on the correct page, you must see a Downloads list when you scroll down.

## Step 2

On the downloads list, click on the file named:

```
BINARY_NAME-darwin-x86_64.tar.gz
```

Clicking on it downloads the file.

If you're unable to find it, here it is on the downloads list:

To verify whether you've downloaded the right file, you should see the following file in your `Downloads` folder:

```
BINARY_NAME-darwin-x86_64.tar.gz
```

## Step 3

Double click on `BINARY_NAME-darwin-x86_64.tar.gz` in order to extract it.

To determine whether you've correctly extracted it, you must see a file named `BINARY_NAME` appear.

To illustrate, your `Downloads` folder should somewhat appear as this:
