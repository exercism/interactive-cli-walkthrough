::Verifying Homebrew Installation
# Installing Homebrew on a Mac

Great! Now that you've opened the terminal on your Mac, we need to install Homebrew next. Homebrew is a package manager for the Mac, and installing it makes the whole Exercism installation process easier. If you want to Exercism manually, [[Manual Installation on a Mac->Manual Installation on a Mac]] would be helpful.

Since Homebrew is pretty common on Macs, let's first verify whether you have it on your computer.

## Step 1

To verify if homebrew is installed, type in the following text into your terminal:

```
brew
```

> Sidenote: This tutorial contains more of these. Whenever you see text surrounded by a box, it means that you need to type in or copy and paste the text in the box. We recommend the latter to avoid typos.

After typing in the command, hit the `Enter` key.

After hitting the `Enter` key, your terminal should give you a reply.

### Homebrew is not installed

When you see the following reply, it means that Homebrew isn't installed on your Mac yet.

> Sidenote: This reply means that the terminal doesn't understand the `brew` command. Your terminal may reply with a different text, but if it means that the `brew` command isn't understood, it still means that homebrew isn't installed.

### Homebrew is installed

When you see the following reply, it means that Homebrew is installed.

> Sidenote: This reply means that the terminal understands the `brew` command. Your terminal replies with examples of how the `brew` command can be used. Again, the text can vary from terminal to terminal, but the underlying principle should be that the terminal understands the `brew` command.

## Wrapping up

If you've reached the end of this tutorial, you should be able to determine whether you've installed Homebrew or not.
