# Determine process architecture on a Mac

The first step in installing Exercism manually is to determine your Mac's process architecture. For this step, we need to use the terminal. If you need instructions on how to open the terminal, [[Opening the Terminal on a Mac]] would be helpful.

Let's get started!

## Tutorial

### Step 1: Determining process architecture

#### Exercise

To determine your process architecture, paste in the following command into your Mac:

```
uname -m | if grep -q 64; then echo "64-bit CPU"; else echo "32-bit CPU"; fi
```

Hit `Enter` after you've pasted in the command.

#### Verify

##### 32-bit process architecture

If you're on a 32-bit process architecture, your Terminal would reply with this:

##### 64-bit process architecture

If you're on a 64-bit process architecture, your Terminal would reply with this:

##### Unknown architecture

If your output doesn't match any of the above, click on "I don't know" below and we could recommend steps to help you.

### Wrapping up

If you've reached the end of this tutorial without any problems, you should now know what your process architecture is!
